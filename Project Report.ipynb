    "The credibility of this report stems from several key elements. Firstly, the dataset used in our analysis is sourced directly from the official Milwaukee government website, ensuring data integrity and reliability. We are committed to robust and transparent data analysis, with a focus on providing reliable results through appropriate statistical testing. Additionally, we welcome feedback from peers and mentors to further enhance the report's trustworthiness.\n",

We will compare both bootstrapping and asymptotic methods to ensure robustness and comprehensiveness in our findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence Intervals: Alongside hypothesis testing, we will calculate confidence intervals for the mean price per square foot for both property types. These intervals will provide a range of values within which we can be confident the true population parameter lies, offering a more complete perspective on property values.\n",

    "We expect that our analysis will reveal insights into the pricing disparities between Residential and Commercial properties. If a statistically significant difference in mean price per square foot exists, this finding can have substantial implications for real estate investors, property developers, and city planners. Stakeholders may use this information to make more informed decisions about property investments, zoning regulations, and urban development strategies.\n"
